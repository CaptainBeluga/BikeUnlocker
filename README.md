# Bike Unlocker
Another challenge hinted by a friend, I created a Virtual Test of lock picking a combination of a bike padlock with three numbers.

I wrote it when i was 14 yr old.


# Usage
! I created this script only for education purpose, it's only a Virtual Test !

    GUIDE:

    1. Type a PIN of three numbers

    2. The program will create all the possible combinations and will always check if the "PIN GENERATED" is the same to your PIN you just typed.
    
    3. It is not a passing of variable, check in the code. It is a combinations creator.

You can copy my system or implement it,unleash your creativity ;)
